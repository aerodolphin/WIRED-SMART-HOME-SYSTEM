## Wired Smart Home System

A wired smart home system offers several advantages over a wireless smart home system. Here is a list of advantages of a wired smart home system compared to a wireless one:

* **Reliability:** Wired smart home systems are known for their reliability. Since they rely on physical cables to connect devices and sensors throughout the home, they tend to be more stable and less prone to interference compared to wireless systems [2]. Wired connections provide a consistent and uninterrupted connection, reducing the chances of signal dropouts or connectivity issues.

* **Security:** Wired smart home systems are generally more secure than wireless systems. Since the data transmitted through wired connections travels over physical cables, it is less susceptible to hacking or unauthorized access compared to wireless signals that can be intercepted. This can be particularly important when it comes to sensitive data or home security systems.

* **Latency:** Wired connections offer lower latency compared to wireless connections. Latency refers to the time it takes for data to travel between devices. Wired connections have a direct and dedicated pathway, resulting in faster response times. This can be beneficial for devices that require real-time interaction, such as streaming media or gaming devices.

* **Bandwidth** Wired connections generally provide higher bandwidth compared to wireless connections. This means that wired smart home systems can handle larger amounts of data at a faster rate. It can be advantageous for bandwidth-intensive tasks like streaming high-definition video, transferring large files, or using multiple devices simultaneously.

* **Interferences:** Unlike wireless signals, wired connections are not susceptible to signal interference from other electronic devices or physical obstacles. Wireless signals can be affected by factors such as distance, walls, and other devices operating on the same frequency, potentially leading to reduced signal strength or disruptions. With a wired smart home system, you can minimize these interference issues.

* **Limitations:** Wired smart home systems are not subject to the limitations of Wi-Fi networks. Wireless networks may have limitations on the number of devices they can support simultaneously. In contrast, a wired system can handle a larger number of devices without experiencing congestion or reduced performance.

* **No Batteries:** No batteries to deal with. Wireless devices require constant battery supervision and often need frequent battery replacements.

These advantages make wired smart home systems an attractive option for those seeking reliability, security, low latency, high bandwidth, and freedom from wireless limitations and interference. However, it's essential to consider the specific needs of your smart home setup.












## HOW TO INSERT IMAGES FROM GOOGLE DRIVE

1.  In Google Drive copy the URL from Share

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hh8nTVjhxHy7q7fojxTQ-47QJweu6M-2/view

1.  Take from the URL the photo ID between "d/" and "/view"

In this case the ID is: 1hh8nTVjhxHy7q7fojxTQ-47QJweu6M-2

1.  Insert the ID into the github image code:

```
![alt text](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1hh8nTVjhxHy7q7fojxTQ-47QJweu6M-2)
```
