## HOW TO INSERT IMAGES FROM GOOGLE DRIVE

1.  In Google Drive copy the URL from Share

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hh8nTVjhxHy7q7fojxTQ-47QJweu6M-2/view

1.  Take from the URL the photo ID between "d/" and "/view"

In this case the ID is: 1hh8nTVjhxHy7q7fojxTQ-47QJweu6M-2

1.  Insert the ID into the github image code:

```
![alt text](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1hh8nTVjhxHy7q7fojxTQ-47QJweu6M-2)
```
